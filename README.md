EXPLAINING THE CODE

Different Pages For A Website

I liked the idea of seperating my html into a few diferent parts.
So i did that and made a universal CSS document and then one for individual parts as needed
The Javascript was the tricky part and took the longest. Since this is a javascript project 
I'll go over the things i learned for javascript.

useing methods such as splice, setItem and Assign

manipulation of arrays was one of the easier things to do 

the hardest part was getting JS to manipulate the document

it didn't click for me at first until i spent a coupple hours watching youtube videos 
after grilling it into my brain i found some sucsess with things like manipulating parent elements
and turning my divs into varyables
